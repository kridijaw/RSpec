# RSpec

Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

- [ ] implement `#add` method which passes calculator_spec.rb
- [ ] implement test `#multiply`, `#subtract`, or `#divide`
- [ ] test `rspec --format documentation`
- [ ] implement `.rspec'

1. "Let’s implement a new test case for your `#add` method, written out for you below. Run the test to see the failure. Write the minimum code necessary to get both tests to pass, then refactor if necessary.

```ruby
#spec/calculator_spec.rb
   
describe Calculator do
  describe "#add" do
    it "returns the sum of two numbers" do
      # removed for brevity
    end
   
    # add this
    it "returns the sum of more than two numbers" do
      calculator = Calculator.new
      expect(calculator.add(2, 5, 7)).to eql(14)
    end
  end
end
```
2. Write a test for a new `Calculator` method (`#multiply`, `#subtract`, or `#divide`) using a new `describe` block. Include at least one `it` block with an appropriate expectation clause. Get it to pass, and refactor if necessary.
   
3. In the terminal, try running your failing or passing tests with `rspec --format documentation`. What’s different?

4. RSpec reads command line configurations from `.rspec`, one of the two files generated when RSpec is initialized in a project. If you liked the output you got with `--format documentation`, you can use the `.rspec` file to hold that flag. In doing so, you won’t have to type it in every time you run your test suite. Open the file in your text editor and, on a new line, add `--format documentation`. For more information on configuring RSpec, see the docs [here](https://rspec.info/features/3-12/rspec-core/configuration/)."
